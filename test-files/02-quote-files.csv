# QUOTE-FILES.CSV
# refer to blueprint on suitable options for filesize, and what they relate to
# We use a master seed, to allow the files being generated to be identically created, without needing the file to be supplied
#
# filesize : tiny, small, medium, large, huge, giga, tera, chunka, chunkb
# seed : unique file seed number
# size : bytes of file to create within its filesize spec
# md5 : this is the md5 hash of the file which will be created, needed as some processor implementations of seed files can generate different content
#
#    tiny = files with a size below 128k
#    small = files with a size of 129k > 4Mb
#    medium = files with a size of 4Mb > 32MB
#    large = files with a size of 32MB > 60MB
#    huge = files with a size of 128MB > 1G
#    giga = files with a size of 1G > 20G
#    tera = files with a size of 20G > 100G
