Control files will initially be used from github to program the scheduler on what tasks it will be executing in the following 50 minute period.

The control file will be in XML format

<Schedule>
  <Task> 
    <TaskRef>001</TaskRef>     
    <Description>Brief Task Description</Description> 
    <TimePeriod>5</TimePeriod>
    <TimeOffset>0</TimeOffset>
    <TestType>Download</TestType>
    <TestOptions>
      <Option key="filesize" value="tiny"/>
      <Option key="workers" value="1"/>
      <Option key="offset" value="false"/> 
      <Option key="repeat" value="true"/>
      <Option key="timeout" value="30"/> 
      <Option key="retry" value="3"/> 
    </TestOptions> 
  </Task>
  <Task> 
    <-- repeating task block with other tests -->
  </Task>
</Schedule>

Taskref : Unique task reference starting at 001
Description : Brief few words of what this task is doing
TimePeriod : Time slot within the 60 minute window when we would like this task to start, please reference scheduler blueprint for more info.
TimeOffset : Value in minutes, upto 5 minutes, that will be applied randomly to the TimePeriod to allow a delta in when tasks start.
TestType : The type of test this task will execute, i.e Download, Quote, Upload, refer to blueprint for more info on these tests.

TestOptions : These are TestType specific over-rides, that can be specified for a task

From the "Download" TestType we provide;

filesize : The size of file to download - an XML file of valid network files will be provided, from which the agent can choose randomly based on size.
    tiny = files with a size below 128k
    small = files with a size of 129k > 4Mb
    medium = files with a size of 4Mb > 32MB
    large = files with a size of 32MB > 60MB
    huge = files with a size of 128MB > 1G
    giga = files with a size of 1G > 20G
    tera = files with a size of 20G > 100G
    chunka = file with a size of exactly 4Mb
    chunkb = file with a size of exactly 64MB

workers : the number of thread workers which will run this task - WARNING : this directly impacts the load the agent will generate.  A value of 1 (default) will 
cause a single thread, to be running the download task, setting this to 2 causes another thread to be created and 2 tests would be running by the scheduler.
Setting this too high (i.e 100) could see the agent machine grind to a halt - It would be expected that tests being run will slowly increment this number to 
maintain network stability.

offset : an arbitary time period, to apply a delta to the tasks to ensure they don't all start at the same time (only applicable when workers > 1)

repeat : if present, and set to true - then the task will repeat until killed by the 55m scheduler.

timeout : how long we allow a task to execute before we force terminate it.

retry : how many times we retry a task, if it fails.
