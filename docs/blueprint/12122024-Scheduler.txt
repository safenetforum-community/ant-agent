The scheduler will be responsible for calling job definitions, that have been downloaded from github, and allocated time periods and control options from a
repeating 60 minute period.

The scheduler will be subject to the kill-switch logic, to ensure the ability to terminate the test exists

There will be no concept of date, days, hours - the only unit will be minutes from 0 through to 59

Scheduled tests will be executed over a fixed 1 hour time window, to minimize the impact of timezones in syncronization of tasks.  This provides us with upto
50 minutes in which tasks can be executed.

The scheduler will refresh tasks automatically at 00 minutes, plus a random offset to avoid overloading github.

The smallest scheduled unit is 1 minute

The scheduler will not allow multiple tasks to be scheduled at the same time period.

An optional time delta can be used to offset task execution by upto 5 minutes.

The 5 minutes following the hour (01m,02m,03m,04m,05m) are reserved for fetching the new tasks to run - no tasks will be allowed to execute in this time period.

The 5 minutes before the hour (55m,56m,57m,58m,59m) are reserved for cool down (cool down period) of tasks, and will not be used for job execution.  This
is to ensure an orderly and control shutdown of the tasks, and to ensure we are not overwelming the target.

Tasks that are still running inside the cool down period will be subject to being forceably killed by the thread worker agent.
